# Campus-Area-Network-Project
●	Designed and implemented a campus area network (CAN) using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to enhance network performance and security.
●	Reduced CPU overhead by segmenting network traffic, optimizing efficiency by limiting broadcast domains.
●	Enhanced security for sensitive data by implementing VLANs, which contributed to a 20% increase in the network's overall data protection level.
●	Enhanced network reliability by implementing VLAN broadcast domain isolation, cutting
troubleshooting time by 30% and demonstrating advanced network management skills.
